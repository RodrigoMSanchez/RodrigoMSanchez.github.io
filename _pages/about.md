Welcome! I am a PhD candidate at the Swiss Graduate School of Public Administration ([IDHEAP](https://www.unil.ch/idheap/en/home.html)), University of Lausanne. My dissertation, titled *Institutions, Public Opinion, and Inequality*, is supervised by [Flavia Fossati](https://www.unil.ch/idheap/en/home/menuinst/unitescompetences/inegalites-et-integration/flavia-fossati.html).

Before starting my PhD, I was a Pre-Doctoral Fellow at the [Immigration Policy Lab](https://immigrationlab.org/) at ETH Z&uuml;rich (2021--2023), supervised by [Dominik Hangartner](https://hangartner.net/). I hold an MA in Economics from Central European University and a BA in Economics from Kansas State University.

My research interests lie in **causal inference**, **immigration**, and **education policy**. I study how institutions and public opinion shape inequality, with a focus on immigrant integration and educational tracking systems.
