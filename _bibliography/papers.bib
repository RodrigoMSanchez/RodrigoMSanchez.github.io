  abstract={Using survey experiments in six countries, we find that immigrant students are judged as less deserving of financial aid than natives. High-achieving immigrants can overcome this penalty, but working harder does not help. The immigrant penalty is driven by right-wing voters, while left-leaning respondents treat immigrants equally.}

  abstract={Evaluating a cash transfer (~\$190) to vulnerable Venezuelan immigrants in Peru, we find that the intervention improves overall integration by 0.12--0.28 standard deviations, driven by gains in economic, social, and navigational dimensions. The cash transfer also boosts self-employment by 2--5 percentage points, with self-employed beneficiaries achieving higher income gains than wage workers. Effects diminish sharply with household size, highlighting the need for household-adjusted payments.}
